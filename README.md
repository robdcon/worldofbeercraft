World of Beer Craft

Run the data.json api on http://localhost:3000 usinr npx json-server data.json from the _files folder in app

Run the app using ng serve --open to open at http://localhost:4200

You can use the filters to request beer items based on ABV and IBU values 

You can also filter beers using the query string option via the search bar

Skip links available through tab key however accessibilty is not fully developed yet due to time constraints

Notes:

Testing is evident on some components however I ran out of time to implement tests on all components
I think the app could be refactored better, however it is my first Angular app so more research is required

I wanted to challenge myself to learn angular quickly to demonstrate ability to pick up new skills and considering it is the technology you use, I thought it would be a good idea, however I must admit the learning curve ment some important aspects such as testing and accessibilty were compromised by the the time constraints which were eaten up a lot by having to research the framework.

I hope it at least demonstartes my skills to some degree, 

Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward to your feedback!
